## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS Extension Language

### What I learned

This challenge was a good chance to practice mobile-first flow but also positioning of elements (dropdown lists).
I also took the chance of this challenge to practice SASS for the first time and realized how links to external resources shall take into account actual position of the compiled .css file :weary:.

### Continued development

The major challenge was handling the mobile-first approach. At the larger size everything needs to be repositioned and the best "display" option chosen.
It took quite a time to find the right solution and having smooth transitions.
Animation solutions were also not so easy to find out.
I definitely need some more training on the above aspects.
